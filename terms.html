            <p class="mb-2">
Deplex AI (the “Company” or “we” or “us”) website and other software, media channels, or applications connected thereto are made available to you in accordance with the following terms and conditions (the “Terms”). It is important that you read the Terms carefully, as your use of the website will automatically constitute your agreement to be legally bound by the terms and conditions set out herein. In addition to any applicable license agreements on our website, these Terms also govern your use or order of the digital and physical products provided through or in connection with the website.
            </p>
<h2 class="font-display mt-6 mb-2 text-white">
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
From time to time, we may offer for sale non-fungible tokens (“Company NFTs”), other digital assets (“Digital Assets”) and/or physical products (collectively, "Company Products") through our website. Our website is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use our website. To participate in purchasing or receiving such Company Products, you agree to comply with the specific terms and conditions, if any, associated with the respective Company Products in addition to these Terms. Any payments you make for Company Products processed through third-party partners will be subject to the separate terms and conditions, if any, associated with such third-party partners.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over these payments or transactions and that we do not have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions once made. We have no liability to you or any third party for any claims or damages arising from any payments or transactions you engage in via the website through any third-party services.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
We may also occasionally sell Company Products on our website via one or more auction processes (each an “Auction”). You agree to abide by all rules and regulations for each Auction. Unless otherwise stated, we will take custody of any funds attached to any Auction bids and will refund such funds to all bids that fail to win an Auction as soon as reasonably practicable. If you win an Auction, you may redeem the underlying Company Product at a time of your choosing within reason.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
Our website is our proprietary property, and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, and graphics on the website (collectively, the “Content”) and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the “Marks”) are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
The Content and the Marks are provided on the Site “AS IS” for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in these Terms or under an applicable license on our website, no part of the website and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, without our express prior written permission. If you are eligible, you are granted a limited license to access and use the website solely for personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights in and to the website, the Content, and the Marks.

DIGITAL ASSETS.
</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
Digital Assets purchased from our website may be purchased, sold, and/or traded on third-party marketplaces or exchange sites (such transactions as “Secondary Transactions”). Secondary Transactions will be subject to the terms and conditions of such sites. We are not a party to any Secondary Transaction. We do not guarantee the availability or functionality of any such sites, and your use is at your own risk. We have no liability to you or any third party for any claims or damages that may arise from your Secondary Transactions or use of such external sites.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
Unless otherwise stated by us, you will be solely responsible for paying any and all income, capital gains, sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with Digital Assets purchased or otherwise received by you (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, receipt or sale of a Company NFT).
		</p>
<p class="mb-2">
        With respect to Digital Assets released by us, you understand and acknowledge that we will only recognize such Digital Assets on the Proof of Stake Ethereum chain (with chainID of 1) as subject to the applicable license on our website and eligible to participate in activities of the Company which are tied to ownership of our Digital Assets. If there are any further changes to the operating rules of the underlying software protocol of a relevant blockchain network that results in two different branches of the relevant blockchain network, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) the Company NFTs on either branch of the forked software protocol entirely.
</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        You acknowledge and agree that we assume no liability, obligation, or responsibility whatsoever concerning the operation of underlying software protocols or an unsupported branch of a forked software protocol, including but not limited to any viable Proof of Work Ethereum Fork, and you acknowledge and assume the risk of the same.
